Every voicemail must sound like a real human outbound agent — not a robot reading variables.

The system must preprocess the script BEFORE sending to ElevenLabs.

Create a middleware text-normalization layer that converts structured CRM variables into natural spoken language.

The agent personality:

Mid-30s professional support representative

Calm, relaxed pacing

Slight hesitations but NOT robotic fillers

Conversational tone, not scripted reading

Slight pauses where commas or thoughts naturally occur

Speaks like a human remembering details, not reciting a database

Do NOT add robotic phrases like:
"This message is regarding"
"Dear customer"
"This is an automated message"

Instead it should sound like:
Someone looking at the account while talking.

VARIABLE NORMALIZATION RULES

You must transform variables before audio generation.

1. Names

{first_name} {last_name}

Rules:

Only say last name when natural

Default: use first name conversationally

If both present → "John Miller" first time, then just "John"

Example:
Input: John Miller
Output: "John…"

NOT:
"J O H N"
"Customer John Miller"

2. Phone Numbers

{phone}

Speak digit groups like humans naturally do.

Rules:

US/Canada numbers grouped 3-3-4

Pause between groups

Never read continuous digits

Example:
3603065536 →
"three six zero… three zero six… five five three six"

Add natural rhythm — slight pauses between groups.

3. Dates

{date}

Convert to spoken date format.

Format:
DD/MM/YYYY
MM/DD/YYYY
YYYY-MM-DD

Convert to:

"March twenty-eighth, twenty twenty-two"
"the 14th of July, twenty twenty-three"

Rules:

Month words, not numbers

Year spoken naturally (twenty twenty-four, not two zero two four)

Add “the” optionally for conversational tone

4. Money

{amount}

Convert to spoken currency.

1129 →
"about eleven hundred twenty-nine dollars"

970 →
"roughly nine seventy"
or
"around nine hundred seventy dollars"

Rules:

Never read digit by digit

Round naturally if conversational context allows

Prefer casual phrasing: about / around / roughly

5. Address

{address}

Expand abbreviations and speak naturally.

Dictionary:
St → Street
Rd → Road
Ave → Avenue
Blvd → Boulevard
Dr → Drive
Ln → Lane
Ct → Court
Apt → Apartment
Ste → Suite
NJ → New Jersey
CA → California
TX → Texas
IL → Illinois

Example:
123 W Main St Apt 4B Newark NJ

Output:
"123 West Main Street, Apartment 4B, Newark New Jersey"

Rules:

No commas spoken literally

Smooth phrasing

Pause between sections

6. Email

{email}

Speak like humans do:

johnsmith92@gmail.com
 →

"john smith ninety two at gmail dot com"

Rules:

@ = "at"

. = "dot"

Separate words where readable

Numbers spoken normally

HUMANIZATION LAYER

After variable replacement, apply conversational smoothing:

Add micro-pauses:

After name

Before bad news / good news

Before call-back instruction

Replace robotic phrasing:

"you qualify for a reimbursement of $970"
→
"looks like you’re actually getting about nine seventy back"

"please contact us"
→
"just give me a quick call back"

OUTPUT STYLE EXAMPLE

Final generated text must sound like someone talking while checking a screen:

"Hey John… this is Cody from your security provider.
I was just looking at your account from March twenty-eighth, twenty twenty-two…
You had picked up the protection plan for about eleven hundred twenty-nine dollars.
So — quick update.
The system you’re on isn’t really compatible anymore with the newer AI protection we rolled out.
But the good news… since you had the lifetime plan… looks like you’re getting about nine seventy back.
Just call me at three six zero… three zero six… five five three six… and I’ll handle it for you."

IMPLEMENTATION REQUIREMENT

Build a preprocessing function:

processVoicemailScript(script, variables) → returns naturalSpeechScript

Pipeline:

Replace variables

Normalize (names, phone, date, amount, address, email)

Conversational smoothing

Send final text to ElevenLabs

The audio must NEVER contain raw placeholders or robotic numeric reading.
