You are a senior SaaS UI/UX engineer and frontend architect.

You are redesigning an existing working application called:

Open Human — Power Sales Assistant

IMPORTANT RULES:

DO NOT change backend logic

DO NOT modify API routes

DO NOT modify dialing behavior

DO NOT modify voicemail generation logic

DO NOT modify CSV processing

DO NOT modify Telnyx / ElevenLabs integration

DO NOT rename database fields

DO NOT break campaign execution

Your job is ONLY:
Redesign the interface to look and behave like Google Ads UI/UX

This is a visual + structural redesign only.

The app must feel like:
Google Ads + modern outbound call center dashboard

Clean, minimal, data-focused, professional SaaS.

UX BEHAVIOR RULES

Everything should feel like an ad manager platform:

No popups → use slide panels
No page reloads → SPA behavior
Instant feedback
Inline editing
Tables sortable
Filters on every table
Search bars everywhere

PERFORMANCE

UI must remain fast even with:
10,000 contacts
Active live calls updating
Multiple campaigns running

Use pagination + virtualization for tables

FINAL RESULT EXPECTATION

The tool should visually feel like:

Google Ads but for outbound calling & voicemail automation.

A new user should instantly understand:
Create Campaign → Upload List → Select Voicemail → Launch → Monitor Live Calls
