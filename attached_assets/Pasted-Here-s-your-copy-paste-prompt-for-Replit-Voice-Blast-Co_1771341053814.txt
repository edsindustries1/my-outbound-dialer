Voice Blast – Complete UI/UX Redesign (Luxury Minimal)

Do not change any functionality, backend logic, API connections, or existing features. Only redesign the visual layer — HTML, CSS, and any frontend animations. Everything must still work exactly as before.

Design Direction: Luxury Minimal SaaS

Think: Linear.app meets Vercel meets a high-end fintech product. The goal is to look like a Silicon Valley startup that raised $10M and hired a world-class design team. Every pixel should feel intentional.

1. Color Theme

Use this exact palette:

Background (primary): 
#0A0A0F — near-black, slightly cool-toned
Background (surface/cards): 
#111118 — slightly lighter than base
Border color: 
#1E1E2E — subtle dark border
Accent (primary): 
#7C3AED — deep electric violet
Accent (glow): 
#A855F7 — lighter purple for glows and highlights
Text (primary): 
#F1F0FF — soft off-white, easy on the eyes
Text (secondary): 
#6B7280 — muted gray for labels and descriptions
Success: 
#10B981
Warning: 
#F59E0B
Error/Danger: 
#EF4444
No pure white. No pure black. No flat blue bootstrap colors. Ditch anything that looks generic.

2. Typography

Use Inter (Google Font) as the primary font — import it if not already present
Headlines: font-weight: 700, slightly wide letter-spacing
Labels and UI text: font-weight: 400–500, font-size: 13–14px
Make sure font sizes, weights, and line heights feel balanced and refined — not too big, not too cramped
3. Layout & Spacing

Add generous padding inside all cards and panels (at least 24px)
Use consistent 8px base spacing grid throughout
All cards should have: border-radius: 16px, subtle border: 1px solid #1E1E2E, and a very faint inner glow or box shadow: box-shadow: 0 0 0 1px #1E1E2E, 0 8px 32px rgba(0,0,0,0.4)
Sidebar (if present) should feel sleek and minimal — icon + label, with a soft purple highlight on the active tab
Everything should be vertically and horizontally balanced
4. Buttons

Primary button: deep violet background 
#7C3AED, white text, border-radius: 10px, subtle glow on hover: box-shadow: 0 0 16px rgba(124, 58, 237, 0.5)
Secondary button: transparent background, border: 1px solid #2D2D40, light text, darkens on hover
All buttons should have a press-down micro-animation: transform: scale(0.97) on click, smooth transition: all 0.15s ease
No rounded-pill buttons unless it's a tag or badge
5. Input Fields

Background: 
#0D0D14
Border: 1px solid #2A2A3D
On focus: border changes to 
#7C3AED with a faint glow: box-shadow: 0 0 0 3px rgba(124, 58, 237, 0.2)
Text color: 
#F1F0FF
Placeholder color: 
#3D3D55
border-radius: 10px, padding: 10px 14px
Font size: 14px
6. Navigation / Tabs

Tabs should look clean and modern — not like default browser tabs
Active tab: soft violet underline or a filled pill highlight with background: rgba(124, 58, 237, 0.15) and left border accent 3px solid #7C3AED
Inactive tabs: muted gray text, no background, subtle hover state
Smooth transition between tab states: transition: all 0.2s ease
7. Animations & Interactions

Page load: Fade in with staggered slide-up for each section — opacity: 0 → 1, translateY(20px) → 0, staggered by 100ms per element
Hover on cards: subtle lift — transform: translateY(-2px), box-shadow slightly deeper
Click/tap anywhere: ripple effect that matches the violet accent color
Sidebar or tab switches: smooth crossfade or slide transition, not instant jumps
All transitions: ease or cubic-bezier(0.4, 0, 0.2, 1) — never linear, never jarring
8. Cards & Panels

Every section should be wrapped in a card with the surface color 
#111118
Add a very subtle top-border gradient on important cards: border-top: 1px solid rgba(124, 58, 237, 0.4)
Stats or metrics should have a clean number display — large bold number, small muted label underneath
Avoid flat sections with no visual separation — use border, shadow, or spacing to create depth
9. Call Logs Table

Dark table with alternating row backgrounds: 
#0A0A0F and 
#0E0E16
Row hover: soft highlight background: rgba(124, 58, 237, 0.06)
Column headers: uppercase, font-size: 11px, letter-spacing: 0.08em, muted color 
#6B7280
Status badges (ringing, answered, dropped, voicemail): colored pill badges — green, blue, red, gray respectively
Clean divider lines: border-bottom: 1px solid #1A1A28
10. Logo & Header

The Voice Blast logo should sit in the top-left — icon + wordmark
Logo icon: a stylized sound wave or signal burst in violet/purple gradient
Wordmark: "Voice Blast" in Inter bold, white text, clean and modern
Header bar: background: rgba(10, 10, 15, 0.85), with a backdrop-filter: blur(12px), feels like frosted glass
Subtle bottom border on header: border-bottom: 1px solid #1E1E2E
11. Scrollbars

Style the custom scrollbars to match the theme:

css
::-webkit-scrollbar { width: 6px; }
::-webkit-scrollbar-track { background: #0A0A0F; }
::-webkit-scrollbar-thumb { background: #2A2A3D; border-radius: 10px; }
::-webkit-scrollbar-thumb:hover { background: #7C3AED; }
Final Note

Every single element — buttons, inputs, tabs, cards, tables, text, spacing — must feel like it was designed by a human who has studied great SaaS products and cares about every detail. It should feel expensive, modern, and intentional. Remove any default browser styling, bootstrap defaults, or anything that looks auto-generated. This is a premium product. Make it look like one.
