          <p class="testimonial-text">I used to spend 10 hours a day cold calling homeowners off tax delinquent lists. Out of 200 dials, maybe 15 people would actually pick up — the rest went straight to voicemail. Now I load my skip traced list into Open Human, hit launch, and it dials through 500 numbers while I'm out driving for dollars. I come back to 30+ voicemails dropped and 4-5 hot leads transferred directly to my phone. We closed 3 extra deals last month just from the callback rate on those AI voicemails. Homeowners literally call back saying "Hey, I got your message about my property on Elm Street." They think I personally called them.</p>

          <p class="testimonial-text">In wholesaling, speed to the seller is everything. Before Open Human, my acquisitions team of 4 was manually dialing and leaving the same generic voicemail 200 times a day. They were burned out. Now we upload our absentee owner lists and the system handles it all — 2,000 dials a day across the whole team. The real magic is the personalized voicemails. Each homeowner hears their name and address in the message, so when they call back, they already feel like we know their situation. Our callback rate went from 2% to almost 11%. That's the difference between 4 deals a month and 12.</p>

          <p class="testimonial-text">We sell final expense and Medicare supplement plans. Our agents were spending 6 hours a day dialing leads from mailers and internet forms — and 80% of the time nobody answered. Open Human changed our entire operation. We upload our aged lead lists, the system dials through them, and when someone actually picks up it transfers straight to an available agent. But what really sold us was the AI personalized voicemail. When a lead hears "Hi Margaret, this is about the life insurance information you requested" in a natural, warm voice — they call back. Our agents went from 3 appointments a week to 8-10. In insurance, trust is everything, and this tool builds it before we even have a conversation.</p>

          <p class="testimonial-text">Our Medicare enrollment team used to dread AEP season. 60 days to reach thousands of seniors, and most of them don't answer unknown numbers. We started using Open Human's personalized voicemail system and the results were immediate. Each senior hears a message with their name, their current plan details, and a reason to call back — all in a voice that sounds like their local agent. We saw a 340% increase in inbound callbacks compared to last year's AEP. The seniors who call back are already warm — they're asking questions, not hanging up. It completely flipped our sales process from chasing people to fielding interested callers.</p>

          <p class="testimonial-text">In collections, reaching the right person at the right time is 90% of the battle. We were burning through calling hours with manual dials and generic recorded messages that everyone ignores. Open Human's simultaneous dialing mode lets us push through 800+ accounts a day per collector — but the personalized voicemail is what actually gets people to call back and set up payment arrangements. When a debtor hears a message that references their specific account and speaks to them by name, they take it seriously. Our right-party contact rate doubled, and payment arrangement callbacks went up 67% in the first month. Compliance loves it too — every call is transcribed and logged automatically.</p>

The hardest part of patient collections is getting people to engage — nobody wants to talk about a medical bill. With Open Human, we send personalized voicemails that reference the patient's provider and outstanding balance range without violating HIPAA. The tone is empathetic, not aggressive, and people actually respond. Our contact rate went from 12% to 31%, and our 90-day collection rate improved by 40%. The live transcription also helps with compliance — our QA team can review every conversation without listening to hours of recordings. Best ROI on any tool we've adopted in 15 years.</p>
